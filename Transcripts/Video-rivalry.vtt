00:00:00.522 --> 00:00:03.139
- Industry competitive rivalry,

2
00:00:03.139 --> 00:00:06.579
the focus here, is on the
nature and extent of rivalry

3
00:00:06.579 --> 00:00:09.140
between industry players.

4
00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:12.497
How many competitors are
there in the industry,

5
00:00:12.497 --> 00:00:15.237
and how capable are they?

6
00:00:15.237 --> 00:00:18.416
If there are many competitors

7
00:00:18.416 --> 00:00:22.472
who all offer essentially
equal products or services,

8
00:00:22.472 --> 00:00:26.282
then none of them will be
able to charge premium prices.

9
00:00:26.282 --> 00:00:29.358
When many competitors offer
undifferentiated products,

10
00:00:29.358 --> 00:00:32.207
this tends to reduce
industry attractiveness.

11
00:00:32.207 --> 00:00:33.842
Profits fall.

12
00:00:33.842 --> 00:00:37.997
For example, agricultural
products are commodities

13
00:00:37.997 --> 00:00:41.497
and have a hard time earning high margins.

14
00:00:42.987 --> 00:00:46.537
If rivalry of firms in an industry is low

15
00:00:46.537 --> 00:00:50.293
and firms compete in very
disciplined and predictable ways,

16
00:00:50.293 --> 00:00:54.584
then average levels of
profits tend to be higher.

17
00:00:54.584 --> 00:00:58.221
Discipline rivalry can result
from a number of things.

18
00:00:58.221 --> 00:01:01.739
A long history of the same
firms competing with each other

19
00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:04.240
gives them deep
understanding of each other

20
00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:07.030
and how they will likely
respond to things.

21
00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:11.354
Coke and Pepsi understand
each other intimately.

22
00:01:11.354 --> 00:01:14.365
Sometimes an industry has a large firm

23
00:01:14.365 --> 00:01:18.777
that implicitly sets the rules
of the game for everyone.

24
00:01:18.777 --> 00:01:23.248
When firms know their place
and behave intelligently,

25
00:01:23.248 --> 00:01:25.415
profits tend to be higher.

26
00:01:26.268 --> 00:01:28.022
When the firm acts in a way

27
00:01:28.022 --> 00:01:31.420
that requires a
counter-response by other firms,

28
00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:33.087
rivalry intensifies.

29
00:01:34.206 --> 00:01:36.423
When a firm resorts

30
00:01:36.423 --> 00:01:39.692
to price cuts to capture share,

31
00:01:39.692 --> 00:01:41.523
you can generally expect rivals

32
00:01:41.523 --> 00:01:44.658
to aggressively match the price cut.

33
00:01:44.658 --> 00:01:47.984
Sometimes a spiral of destruction occurs.

34
00:01:47.984 --> 00:01:51.997
Industry profit levels will likely fall.

35
00:01:51.997 --> 00:01:55.269
The airline industry is
a good example of this.

36
00:01:55.269 --> 00:01:58.424
When they have unsold seats,
there is a tendency for them

37
00:01:58.424 --> 00:02:01.042
to offer flights at deep discounts.

38
00:02:01.042 --> 00:02:04.629
These price cuts are typically
quickly met by rivals,

39
00:02:04.629 --> 00:02:07.462
destroying industry profitability.

40
00:02:08.608 --> 00:02:10.852
When firms in an industry compete

41
00:02:10.852 --> 00:02:13.443
with different competitive advantages

42
00:02:13.443 --> 00:02:16.538
and with differentiated
products and services,

43
00:02:16.538 --> 00:02:20.588
generally speaking, there
is little direct rivalry.

44
00:02:20.588 --> 00:02:23.327
Firms are competing for customers.

45
00:02:23.327 --> 00:02:24.622
In these industries,

46
00:02:24.622 --> 00:02:28.241
the profits firms will earn
will be directly related

47
00:02:28.241 --> 00:02:32.599
to the quality of their
competitive advantages.

48
00:02:32.599 --> 00:02:35.439
Intensity of rivalry within an industry

49
00:02:35.439 --> 00:02:38.012
is influenced by a number of factors

50
00:02:38.012 --> 00:02:41.023
such as the number of firms.

51
00:02:41.023 --> 00:02:43.953
A large number of firms increases rivalry

52
00:02:43.953 --> 00:02:45.880
because more firms must compete

53
00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:49.468
for the same customers and resources.

54
00:02:49.468 --> 00:02:51.818
The industry growth rate,

55
00:02:51.818 --> 00:02:56.270
slow market growth causes firms
to fight for market share.

56
00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:58.659
When markets are growing rapidly,

57
00:02:58.659 --> 00:03:01.042
firms compete for new customers,

58
00:03:01.042 --> 00:03:03.861
not directly with each other.

59
00:03:03.861 --> 00:03:07.388
The level of fixed
investments made by firms,

60
00:03:07.388 --> 00:03:09.801
when firms have high fixed costs

61
00:03:09.801 --> 00:03:12.689
and when they must
produce near full capacity

62
00:03:12.689 --> 00:03:14.248
in order to break even,

63
00:03:14.248 --> 00:03:17.848
they will tend to compete
aggressively for market share.

64
00:03:17.848 --> 00:03:19.352
This will increase rivalry

65
00:03:19.352 --> 00:03:23.435
and often lead to lower
prices and lower margins.

66
00:03:24.972 --> 00:03:27.160
Low switching costs,

67
00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:28.896
when customers can freely switch

68
00:03:28.896 --> 00:03:31.000
from one product to another,

69
00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.565
there is an ongoing battle for customers.

70
00:03:34.565 --> 00:03:36.482
This increases rivalry.

71
00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:40.869
Level of product differentiation,

72
00:03:40.869 --> 00:03:43.277
when products are highly similar,

73
00:03:43.277 --> 00:03:46.800
customers will typically
seek out the lowest price.

74
00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:50.510
On the other hand, if products
are different and branded,

75
00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:53.834
this tends to constrain rivalry.

76
00:03:53.834 --> 00:03:55.515
Exit barriers,

77
00:03:55.515 --> 00:03:57.827
if firms cannot quit the industry

78
00:03:57.827 --> 00:03:59.827
without losing a lot of money,

79
00:03:59.827 --> 00:04:02.374
they will tend to compete
more aggressively.

80
00:04:02.374 --> 00:04:03.461
On the other hand,

81
00:04:03.461 --> 00:04:06.227
if firms can exit and get
most of their money back,

82
00:04:06.227 --> 00:04:09.368
rivalry will be less aggressive.

83
00:04:09.368 --> 00:04:11.384
Diversity among rivals,

84
00:04:11.384 --> 00:04:14.110
when an industry has a mix of new,

85
00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:16.504
innovative firms and traditional firms,

86
00:04:16.504 --> 00:04:18.519
or domestic and global firms,

87
00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:21.035
or firms of very different sizes,

88
00:04:21.035 --> 00:04:22.925
there is a real possibility

89
00:04:22.925 --> 00:04:25.545
that the industry will be unstable.

90
00:04:25.545 --> 00:04:27.815
Firms have difficulty

91
00:04:27.815 --> 00:04:30.770
anticipating how their rivals might act.

92
00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:34.046
Rivalry could quickly become volatile.

93
00:04:34.046 --> 00:04:36.421
The backgrounds, the cultures,

94
00:04:36.421 --> 00:04:40.520
and the philosophies of firms
impact how they will compete,

95
00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:44.270
both in the short term
and in the long term.
