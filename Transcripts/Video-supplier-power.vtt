00:00:00.998 --> 00:00:02.698
- Supplier power.

2
00:00:02.698 --> 00:00:05.380
The bargaining power of suppliers to firms

3
00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:07.777
operating in the industry.

4
00:00:07.777 --> 00:00:09.765
Supplier should be thought of

5
00:00:09.765 --> 00:00:14.108
as anyone who provides inputs
to firms in the industry.

6
00:00:14.108 --> 00:00:17.262
These could be raw material suppliers,

7
00:00:17.262 --> 00:00:20.595
labor from labor unions,
distribution services

8
00:00:20.595 --> 00:00:23.638
from trucking companies,
even capital from banks

9
00:00:23.638 --> 00:00:25.587
and venture capitalists.

10
00:00:25.587 --> 00:00:29.504
The basic idea here is
to assess how easy it is

11
00:00:30.338 --> 00:00:32.730
for suppliers to drive up prices

12
00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:37.161
and capture margin from
firms in the industry.

13
00:00:37.161 --> 00:00:39.923
There are several things
that impact supplier power.

14
00:00:39.923 --> 00:00:42.977
The number of suppliers of key inputs,

15
00:00:42.977 --> 00:00:46.186
the uniqueness of suppliers'
products and services,

16
00:00:46.186 --> 00:00:49.148
the relative strength
and control over firms

17
00:00:49.148 --> 00:00:53.321
in the industry, the relative
cost to firms to switch

18
00:00:53.321 --> 00:00:56.863
between suppliers, the
threat that suppliers

19
00:00:56.863 --> 00:00:59.503
might actually integrate forward,

20
00:00:59.503 --> 00:01:03.161
and the relative costs
of the suppliers products

21
00:01:03.161 --> 00:01:07.328
and services to the total
costs of firms in the industry.

22
00:01:09.454 --> 00:01:13.467
Suppliers are powerful when
suppliers are concentrated.

23
00:01:13.467 --> 00:01:16.398
For example, the number of
pharmaceutical companies

24
00:01:16.398 --> 00:01:19.929
providing hospitals with drugs is low,

25
00:01:19.929 --> 00:01:23.012
hence, they can charge higher prices.

26
00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:27.727
When costs to switch between
suppliers are significant.

27
00:01:27.727 --> 00:01:31.020
For example, when a firms
designs an electronic device

28
00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:35.410
to use a unique semiconducted
chip, it gets stuck.

29
00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:37.761
To change its chip, would require it

30
00:01:37.761 --> 00:01:40.320
to redesign its product.

31
00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:44.006
When suppliers could easily
enter the industry themselves,

32
00:01:44.006 --> 00:01:46.153
that is forward integrating.

33
00:01:46.153 --> 00:01:50.320
For example, GM and Ford could
easily become auto dealers.

34
00:01:52.211 --> 00:01:55.982
Suppliers are weak when there
are many competitive suppliers

35
00:01:55.982 --> 00:01:59.152
offering standardized
commodity like products.

36
00:01:59.152 --> 00:02:02.519
For example, tires for automobiles.

37
00:02:02.519 --> 00:02:05.729
When there are only a few
firms in the industry,

38
00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:08.288
for example, paper producing companies

39
00:02:08.288 --> 00:02:11.251
often vertically integrate back

40
00:02:11.251 --> 00:02:14.584
in developing forests and cutting trees.
