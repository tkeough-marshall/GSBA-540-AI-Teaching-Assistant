1
00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:02.380
- If we're being honest,

2
00:00:02.380 --> 00:00:05.860
many companies, especially
large complex companies,

3
00:00:05.860 --> 00:00:07.640
don't really have strategies.

4
00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:10.820
They have goals, mission
statements, vision statements,

5
00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:13.840
long-term plans, all sorts of budgets.

6
00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:15.400
They have forecasts.

7
00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:20.130
People will call them strategies,
but they really are not.

8
00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:23.400
At the core, strategy is about focus.

9
00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:27.000
It's about making choices,
making trade-offs.

10
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.890
Large, complex organizations

11
00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:32.370
don't really focus their resources.

12
00:00:32.370 --> 00:00:35.840
Instead, they pursue
multiple goals at once

13
00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:38.150
hoping that if they do enough things,

14
00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:40.520
some of them will succeed.

15
00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:43.380
So, in a course on strategy,

16
00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:46.760
we should begin by trying to
clear up some of the confusion

17
00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:48.423
around what strategy is.

18
00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:52.273
Let's begin by discussing
what strategy is not.

19
00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:56.950
Strategy is not a formula or a model dump.

20
00:00:56.950 --> 00:00:59.430
Strategy is not a future forecast

21
00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:03.370
no matter how sophisticated
the data analytics are.

22
00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:07.360
Strategy is not a detailed
plan or program of instruction.

23
00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:11.340
It's not a template, or
a list of things to do.

24
00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:14.280
Strategy is not a label
that enhances the importance

25
00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:17.070
of a decision or a functional plan.

26
00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:21.430
For example, attaching
the word strategy to price

27
00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:25.840
does not make a price
strategy a real strategy.

28
00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:29.763
Cutting or lowering prices is
just that, lowering prices.

29
00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:33.330
Developing a competitive,
low-cost strategy

30
00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:36.360
is fundamentally different
from cutting prices,

31
00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:39.360
and calling it a price strategy.

32
00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:43.170
Similarly, getting people
to do data analytics

33
00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:46.320
is not an IT strategy.

34
00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:48.660
Strategy is not fluff, gibberish,

35
00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:52.960
big fancy words masquerading
as strategic concepts.

36
00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:55.780
So, what is strategy?

37
00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:59.260
Let's give the concept of
strategy some definition.

38
00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:01.800
A strategy is an integrated, overarching,

39
00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:04.010
externally oriented concept

40
00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:07.810
of how a firm will achieve its objectives.

41
00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:11.060
It is a unifying theme that
gives coherence and direction

42
00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:13.800
to the actions and
decisions of an individual

43
00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.033
or an organization.

44
00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:19.260
The captains in Admiral Nelson's Navy

45
00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:20.990
didn't have cell phones,

46
00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:23.980
nor did they have sophisticated
forms of communication

47
00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:27.600
to coordinate their naval battle actions.

48
00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:30.410
What they had was a simple guiding policy

49
00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:31.970
of breaking the coherence

50
00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:34.670
of the Spanish and French naval formation,

51
00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:35.990
and turning the naval battle

52
00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:40.980
into a series of one-on-one,
ship-to-ship sea battles.

53
00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:43.500
Nelson's strategy required every captain

54
00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:45.080
to work independently,

55
00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:48.800
making literally dozens
and dozens of decisions

56
00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:51.920
that combined to produce coherent action,

57
00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:55.000
and a startling naval victory.

58
00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.730
A competitive strategy is a game plan,

59
00:02:57.730 --> 00:02:59.430
a cohesive overall approach

60
00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:02.420
that explains how the
firm will beat its rivals,

61
00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:06.033
and earn superior returns
on its investments.

62
00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:12.100
Strategies are needed when a
firm faces a strategic issue,

63
00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:14.980
a new opportunity, or a new challenge.

64
00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:17.600
So, what makes an issue strategic?

65
00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:21.290
First of all, strategic
issues are important.

66
00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:23.690
They can be any managerial
decision or action

67
00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:27.000
which affects the success,
and even survival,

68
00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:28.440
of a business enterprise.

69
00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:31.660
They are, to say, life
and death decisions.

70
00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:35.960
Second, they affect the
organization as a whole.

71
00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:37.440
They require what we refer to

72
00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:39.840
as a general manager's point of view.

73
00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:42.720
Opportunities and problems
need to be addressed

74
00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:45.910
from an integrated,
cross-functional perspective.

75
00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:50.260
Third, they can be apparent,
or below the surface.

76
00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:53.440
But, they have real implications
for the long-term success

77
00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:55.770
or even survival of the firm.

78
00:03:55.770 --> 00:04:00.520
Fourth, strategic issues
can be internal or external.

79
00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:03.490
They can be internal cultural issues,

80
00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:06.240
or they can be needing to
deal with a new technology,

81
00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:07.620
or a new competitor.

82
00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:10.820
All strategic decisions require choice.

83
00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:12.920
If there is no need for a trade off,

84
00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:15.610
then the decision is not truly strategic.

85
00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:18.060
We simply do both things.

86
00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:20.980
Strategic decisions involve
significant commitments

87
00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:23.490
of resources, time, or money

88
00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:25.690
that are often irreversible,

89
00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:28.563
or they are not easily
reversible in the short run.

90
00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:32.500
Investments need to be made today

91
00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:34.100
before their outcomes are known.

92
00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:37.030
It's also important to remember

93
00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:40.600
that a strategic issue is
a problem or a challenge.

94
00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:43.290
It is not an alternative or a solution.

95
00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:46.480
It is not about deciding
between different options.

96
00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:48.700
It is the deep, careful thinking

97
00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:51.430
about the complexities of a situation,

98
00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:54.780
and defining a guiding policy
to overcome the problem,

99
00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:57.623
or to take advantage of an opportunity.
