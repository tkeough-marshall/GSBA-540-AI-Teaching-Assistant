1
00:00:00.744 --> 00:00:02.872
- Threat of substitutes,

2
00:00:02.872 --> 00:00:05.400
competition from products and services

3
00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:07.496
from outside the industry.

4
00:00:07.496 --> 00:00:11.080
Simply put, the threat
of substitution increases

5
00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:14.264
when customers can find
different ways of doing

6
00:00:14.264 --> 00:00:16.616
what you do for them.

7
00:00:16.616 --> 00:00:19.608
For example, streaming
a movie versus going to

8
00:00:19.608 --> 00:00:21.320
a movie theater.

9
00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:24.440
Another example is
disposable diapers destroying

10
00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:27.048
the cloth diaper industry.

11
00:00:27.048 --> 00:00:30.648
If there are lots of readily
available substitutes,

12
00:00:30.648 --> 00:00:34.065
profits in an industry will tend to fall.

13
00:00:35.112 --> 00:00:39.240
Substitution threats can
take different forms.

14
00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:42.728
Not just lowering the price
firms can charge customers.

15
00:00:42.728 --> 00:00:46.424
Sears for instance, once the
largest retailer in the US,

16
00:00:46.424 --> 00:00:48.600
lost its leadership position.

17
00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.480
Sears had entered the
retail industry early

18
00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:54.200
and captured prime
locations on main street

19
00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:57.117
in virtually every city in America.

20
00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:01.976
However, with suburbanization
people stopped

21
00:01:01.976 --> 00:01:05.496
traveling to downtown to go shopping.

22
00:01:05.496 --> 00:01:07.998
They preferred to shop at newly developed

23
00:01:07.998 --> 00:01:09.406
suburban malls.

24
00:01:09.406 --> 00:01:13.294
Sears was now located in the wrong place.

25
00:01:13.294 --> 00:01:16.830
Sears was slow to move
into suburban malls.

26
00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:19.726
This more than anything led to its demise.

27
00:01:19.726 --> 00:01:22.878
Another good example
is the camera industry.

28
00:01:22.878 --> 00:01:25.534
The camera industry has
largely been supplanted

29
00:01:25.534 --> 00:01:26.867
by smart phones.
