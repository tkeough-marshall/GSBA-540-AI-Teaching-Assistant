00:00:01.690 --> 00:00:04.140
- Let's consider what a
generic business model

2
00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:05.540
might look like for a firm

3
00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:07.723
pursuing a differentiation strategy.

4
00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:11.230
As we know, the essence of
a differentiation strategy

5
00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:14.900
is the idea of increasing
customer willingness

6
00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:18.360
to pay for something
that they value highly.

7
00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:20.210
It could be a branded product,

8
00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:22.570
an exceptionally high-quality product,

9
00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:25.283
the latest piece of technology, etc.

10
00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:29.510
What would a differentiation-based

11
00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:31.010
business model look like?

12
00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:34.470
Again, you could begin anywhere.

13
00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:36.990
Let's start with premium prices.

14
00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:40.930
Premium prices obviously
generate high margins.

15
00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:43.170
These higher margins allow for investments

16
00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:46.000
in different forms of uniqueness.

17
00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.670
That could be additional brand marketing

18
00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:52.600
which could induce higher
levels of consumer loyalty.

19
00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:54.920
It could be increased investments in R&amp;D

20
00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:57.000
to produce new, more innovative,

21
00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.730
higher-quality products
which are sought after

22
00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:01.690
by loyal customers.

23
00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:04.100
It could be any other investment

24
00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:06.770
that leads to improvements
in the firm's reputation

25
00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:09.380
which increase consumer loyalty.

26
00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:11.160
Consumer loyalty in turn

27
00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:13.730
leads to an increased willingness to pay,

28
00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:17.150
which in turn allows the
firm to charge premium prices

29
00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:20.023
and a virtuous cycle is created.

30
00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:24.550
There are an infinite
number of business models,

31
00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:26.620
but all innovative business models

32
00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:30.860
come from strategists
using their three sights;

33
00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:33.853
foresight, insight, and cross-sight.

34
00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:36.700
They're created by business leaders

35
00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:40.450
who look at their value
chains and see new ways

36
00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:43.370
and interesting ways
of combining activities

37
00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:46.160
to produce superior returns.

38
00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:48.600
To quote Joan Magretta,
who was a specialist

39
00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.217
on business models;

40
00:01:50.217 --> 00:01:53.087
"Today, business model and strategy

41
00:01:53.087 --> 00:01:57.077
"are among the most
sloppily-used terms in business.

42
00:01:57.077 --> 00:01:59.957
"They're often stretched
to mean everything

43
00:01:59.957 --> 00:02:02.107
"and end up meaning nothing."

44
00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:04.730
What we know for sure

45
00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:07.220
is that successful businesses

46
00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:10.350
must have tightly-linked,
coherent business models

47
00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:13.023
and good strategies.
