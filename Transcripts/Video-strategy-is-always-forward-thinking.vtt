00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:04.230
<v ->Why do some companies succeed over the long term

2
00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:05.510
while others do not?

3
00:00:05.510 --> 00:00:09.010
If you could only list two things, what would you say?

4
00:00:09.010 --> 00:00:12.950
The truth is most firms don't adapt, they die.

5
00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:14.690
Their assets are repurposed.

6
00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:17.910
Sadly, very few firms, even the most successful firms

7
00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:19.830
last more than a few decades.

8
00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:23.140
If you would compare the list of firms on the Dow Jones

9
00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:25.070
in the late 18th century,

10
00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:28.000
you might be surprised that the only one to survive

11
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.040
at least until the 21st century was General Electric

12
00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:35.240
and now they're no longer part of the Dow Jones index.

13
00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:37.570
What distinguishes successful companies

14
00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:39.380
from unsuccessful ones?

15
00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:42.083
My answer, and it's supported by a lot of research,

16
00:00:42.083 --> 00:00:46.120 line:15%
is strategy and management.

17
00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:48.270
Companies that succeed have strategies

18
00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:52.080
that are build on deep insights, prescient foresight,

19
00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:55.860
forward thinking, bold innovative experiments,

20
00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:58.700
a sense of cleverness in the management team.

21
00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:01.930
They have strategies that are coherent and well-formulated.

22
00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:05.130
And importantly, they have courageous leaders,

23
00:01:05.130 --> 00:01:08.710
organizations with strong values and powerful cultures.

24
00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:11.510
They have effective and compelling management teams

25
00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:13.750
who lead and whose organizations

26
00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:16.130
are anxious and excited to follow.

27
00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:18.910
When you look across highly successful firms,

28
00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:21.340
four common elements stand out.

29
00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:23.760
First, they all have goals that are simple,

30
00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:27.230
consistent, long-term focused and that are known

31
00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:31.127
and agreed upon among all members of their organizations.

32
00:01:31.127 --> 00:01:33.350
Nothing derails a firm more quickly

33
00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:35.381
than goals that are unrealistic.

34
00:01:35.381 --> 00:01:37.200
Perhaps more importantly,

35
00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.840
what distinguishes successful firms from others

36
00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:42.240
is that everyone is on the same page.

37
00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.513
Everyone is pulling in the same direction.

38
00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.770
I was once engaged by a major entertainment firm

39
00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:49.060
to do some consulting.

40
00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:51.600
There were about 30-35 managers in the room.

41
00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.150
I asked them to go to whiteboards

42
00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:55.840
and write down the essence of their company's goals.

43
00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:58.761
Sadly, I think we ended up with more different goals

44
00:01:58.761 --> 00:02:01.783
than the number of people in the room.

45
00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:05.340
Rob Grant, the author of our strategy text,

46
00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:06.940
compares in an earlier edition

47
00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:09.116
the objectives of the North Vietnamese

48
00:02:09.116 --> 00:02:11.040
and the U.S. in Vietnam.

49
00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:12.939
General Giap in the North Vietnamese

50
00:02:12.939 --> 00:02:16.444
had a single unifying focused ultimate goal

51
00:02:16.444 --> 00:02:20.040
of reuniting Vietnam under communist rule

52
00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:23.630
and expelling a foreign army from Vietnamese soil.

53
00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:26.840
And they were prepared to take as long as it took to do it.

54
00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:29.660
In contrast, the U.S. efforts in Vietnam

55
00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:32.840
would be deviled by confused objectives.

56
00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:34.850
Was the U.S. supporting an ally?

57
00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:38.580
Stabilizing Southeast Asia from communist expansion?

58
00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:41.350
Fighting a proxy war with the Soviet Union?

59
00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:44.800
Or fighting an ideological war against world communism?

60
00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:49.500
In retrospect, it is easy to see why the U.S. gave up.

61
00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:52.420
Second, successful organizations have deep

62
00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:56.160
and profound understandings of a competitive environment.

63
00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:57.950
Successful firms have built strategies

64
00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:00.700
that are based on some unique and clever insight

65
00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:02.770
about the industries.

66
00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:06.440
These insights are not always complex and profound.

67
00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:08.210
Let me relate a story.

68
00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:11.580
Who remembers a firm called Blue Ribbon Sports?

69
00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:13.820
A business from the 1960s.

70
00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:16.263
I suspect most of you are drawing a blank,

71
00:03:16.263 --> 00:03:19.680
but some of you will have had said, "Ah yes."

72
00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:21.715
That's Phil Knight's first firm.

73
00:03:21.715 --> 00:03:25.660
The precursor to what we know now as Nike.

74
00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:28.200
What was Phil Knight's profound insight?

75
00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:30.705
How was he able to break into a highly competitive

76
00:03:30.705 --> 00:03:33.930
athletic shoe industry dominated internationally

77
00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:38.850
by adidas and Puma and domestically by Converse and kids.

78
00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:39.870
Some of you are thinking

79
00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:41.940
it was because he was a passionate runner.

80
00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:44.030
This gave him the insight to gain entry

81
00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:45.600
into the athletic shoe market.

82
00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:48.400
But that's not where his profound insight came from.

83
00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:49.960
As the story is told, Phil Knight

84
00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:51.492
had finished his MBA at Stanford

85
00:03:51.492 --> 00:03:53.590
and took a sabbatical in Asia

86
00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:55.571
before returning to his job as an accountant

87
00:03:55.571 --> 00:03:58.770
with one of the big eight firms in those days.

88
00:03:58.770 --> 00:04:00.700
While in Asia, he got to observe

89
00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:03.970
the manufacturing competencies of many different companies.

90
00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:07.010
He also came to appreciate that if you were trying

91
00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:11.460
to make high quality athletic shoes at a competitive price,

92
00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:13.730
you probably didn't wanna manufacture those shoes

93
00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:16.470
in Germany, France or the U.S.,

94
00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:19.390
where adidas, Puma and Converse were made.

95
00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:21.920
As the story continues, he returned from Asia,

96
00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:23.443
quit his job at the accounting firm

97
00:04:23.443 --> 00:04:26.220
and started designing shoes in his kitchen

98
00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:27.350
with a waffle iron,

99
00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:29.930
with his coach from the University of Oregon.

100
00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:31.890
His simple yet profound insight

101
00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:35.600
was that he could produce a better quality athletic shoe

102
00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:37.360
at a more competitive price

103
00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:39.900
if he outsourced production to Japan.

104
00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:43.107
This simple insight was the beginning of the firm

105
00:04:43.107 --> 00:04:46.940
that we now know of as Nike.

106
00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:49.010
Let's continue the story though.

107
00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:51.570
Fast-forward with me from the '60s, if you can,

108
00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:52.860
to the early '80s.

109
00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:55.490
Out of nowhere, small British athletic shoe firm

110
00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:56.735
took over the world.

111
00:04:56.735 --> 00:05:00.775
Reebok had discovered its own simple yet profound insight

112
00:05:00.775 --> 00:05:04.510
that allowed it to carve out a significant position

113
00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:08.440
in the highly competitive global athletic shoe industry.

114
00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:10.190
Do you know what their insight was?

115
00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:13.610
I'd like to make the point this way.

116
00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:15.840
Reebok had had the same epiphany

117
00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:19.490
that my three-year-old son had had one Sunday afternoon.

118
00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:20.670
As parents typically do,

119
00:05:20.670 --> 00:05:23.332
my son was taking a bath with his baby sister.

120
00:05:23.332 --> 00:05:24.930
In the middle of his bath,

121
00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:27.630
he had made a discovery, an epiphany.

122
00:05:27.630 --> 00:05:28.790
He jumped out of the bath,

123
00:05:28.790 --> 00:05:30.070
came running into the living room,

124
00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:33.060
jumping up and down, butt naked, water everywhere

125
00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:35.837
and pronounced, "Guess what, Daddy?

126
00:05:35.837 --> 00:05:38.307
"Boys and girls are different!"

127
00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:41.970
You should smile with astonishment

128
00:05:41.970 --> 00:05:45.097
but Reebok had discovered and exploited a market opportunity

129
00:05:45.097 --> 00:05:49.800
based on the simple idea that boys and girls are different.

130
00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:52.000
Up to this point in time, the athletic shoe industry

131
00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.010
had approached producing women's shoes

132
00:05:54.010 --> 00:05:56.100
from this perspective that they needed

133
00:05:56.100 --> 00:06:00.100
to be smaller in size and offered in pastel colors.

134
00:06:00.100 --> 00:06:01.520
In the early '80s,

135
00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:04.261
Reebok introduced a line of women's athletic shoes

136
00:06:04.261 --> 00:06:08.210
that were specifically designed for a women's physiology

137
00:06:08.210 --> 00:06:12.180
and the types of exercise women most commonly engaged in.

138
00:06:12.180 --> 00:06:13.680
It certainly didn't hurt Reebok

139
00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:16.040
that it began to offer women's shoes at the time

140
00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:19.940
when aerobics became a huge global exercise phenomena.

141
00:06:19.940 --> 00:06:23.090
Remember the leg warmers and the leotards?

142
00:06:23.090 --> 00:06:26.550
Reebok was able to leverage the simple yet profound insight

143
00:06:26.550 --> 00:06:29.570
into a global market position.

144
00:06:29.570 --> 00:06:32.103
Let's continue the story one more time.

145
00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:35.497
Out of nowhere, a small Los Angeles firm

146
00:06:35.497 --> 00:06:39.310
caught the imagination of the U.S. in parts of Europe.

147
00:06:39.310 --> 00:06:41.784
A small little startup firm called LA Gear

148
00:06:41.784 --> 00:06:45.223
had identified another simple and profound insight

149
00:06:45.223 --> 00:06:47.470
about the athletic shoe industry.

150
00:06:47.470 --> 00:06:50.230
Some of you will remember the two-color laces,

151
00:06:50.230 --> 00:06:51.920
the flashing lights in the heel.

152
00:06:51.920 --> 00:06:54.023
What had LA Gear discovered?

153
00:06:54.880 --> 00:06:56.580
Their insight was based on observing

154
00:06:56.580 --> 00:06:59.580
how people use their athletic shoes.

155
00:06:59.580 --> 00:07:01.760
They discovered that the majority of people

156
00:07:01.760 --> 00:07:03.730
who purchased and wore athletic shoes

157
00:07:03.730 --> 00:07:07.230
did so without ever intending to use the shoes

158
00:07:07.230 --> 00:07:09.660
in some form of athletic activity.

159
00:07:09.660 --> 00:07:12.012
People were buying the shoes because they were comfortable

160
00:07:12.012 --> 00:07:14.250
and they looked good.

161
00:07:14.250 --> 00:07:17.290
LA Gear's strategy was to design athletic shoes

162
00:07:17.290 --> 00:07:18.650
with an eye to fashion.

163
00:07:18.650 --> 00:07:20.910
In the heyday, in the mid-'90s,

164
00:07:20.910 --> 00:07:24.520
they were selling a half a billion worth of shoes globally.

165
00:07:24.520 --> 00:07:26.890
To me, LA Gear lost its way

166
00:07:26.890 --> 00:07:29.777
when it tried to compete head to head with adidas and Nike

167
00:07:29.777 --> 00:07:32.690
in producing high end athletic shoes

168
00:07:32.690 --> 00:07:34.740
for professional athletes.

169
00:07:34.740 --> 00:07:38.130
Had they stayed focused on athletic shoes with fashion,

170
00:07:38.130 --> 00:07:40.179
I think they'd might be still around today.

171
00:07:40.179 --> 00:07:42.914
By the way, the entrepreneur who started LA Gear

172
00:07:42.914 --> 00:07:46.163
went on to create SKECHERS.

173
00:07:47.550 --> 00:07:49.810
In all successful winning strategies,

174
00:07:49.810 --> 00:07:52.950
you will find a real element of cleverness.

175
00:07:52.950 --> 00:07:57.118
Good strategies always look obvious after the fact.

176
00:07:57.118 --> 00:07:59.110
But when they are formulated,

177
00:07:59.110 --> 00:08:02.130
a good strategy will always have some insight

178
00:08:02.130 --> 00:08:05.250
that is profound in some way or another.

179
00:08:05.250 --> 00:08:08.740
Third, successful strategies are based on an honest

180
00:08:08.740 --> 00:08:11.540
and objective appraisal of resources.

181
00:08:11.540 --> 00:08:13.690
Strengths are identified and magnified

182
00:08:13.690 --> 00:08:15.610
but, and perhaps more importantly,

183
00:08:15.610 --> 00:08:18.640
weaknesses are acknowledged and protected against.

184
00:08:18.640 --> 00:08:21.482
People always want to talk about competencies

185
00:08:21.482 --> 00:08:25.250
but no one wants to talk about incompetence.

186
00:08:25.250 --> 00:08:28.200
No one wants to say, "We're not good at doing that."

187
00:08:28.200 --> 00:08:29.610
When firms are not realistic

188
00:08:29.610 --> 00:08:34.140
about what they can and cannot do, they quickly fail.

189
00:08:34.140 --> 00:08:36.620
Successful firms know what they're good at

190
00:08:36.620 --> 00:08:39.540
and what they are not good at.

191
00:08:39.540 --> 00:08:41.720
Successful firms recognize that they have

192
00:08:41.720 --> 00:08:44.950
to continually upgrade their skills and resources

193
00:08:44.950 --> 00:08:48.020
in order to continue to be successful.

194
00:08:48.020 --> 00:08:52.860
Fourth, successful firms are exceptional at execution.

195
00:08:52.860 --> 00:08:55.280
Without effective implementation,

196
00:08:55.280 --> 00:08:57.422
even the best thought-out strategies

197
00:08:57.422 --> 00:08:59.270
will amount to very little.

198
00:08:59.270 --> 00:09:02.400
Successful firms have galvanizing leadership.

199
00:09:02.400 --> 00:09:03.610
Their top management teams

200
00:09:03.610 --> 00:09:06.055
are capable of reaching tough decisions.

201
00:09:06.055 --> 00:09:08.800
They're exceptional at creating an organization

202
00:09:08.800 --> 00:09:11.420
full of highly motivated team players.

203
00:09:11.420 --> 00:09:15.170
Great firms don't just do one thing 100% better,

204
00:09:15.170 --> 00:09:18.163
they also do 100 things 1% better.

205
00:09:19.040 --> 00:09:22.480
While some want to argue that success is really due to luck,

206
00:09:22.480 --> 00:09:25.980
or that some firms have an easier access to more money,

207
00:09:25.980 --> 00:09:28.050
or better resources at the beginning,

208
00:09:28.050 --> 00:09:30.800
you'll find that these four factors

209
00:09:30.800 --> 00:09:34.000
are almost always present in some form or another

210
00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:36.853
in highly successful enterprises.
