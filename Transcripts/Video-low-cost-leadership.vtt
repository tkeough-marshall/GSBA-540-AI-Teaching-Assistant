00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:02.250
- Let's map out

2
00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:05.770
a generic low-cost
leadership business model.

3
00:00:05.770 --> 00:00:08.270
Every business will have
a different business model

4
00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:10.340
which is unique to their situation.

5
00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:11.980
For the purpose of this example,

6
00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:13.683
we'll over-simplify things.

7
00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:17.890
As we know, a low-cost leadership strategy

8
00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:20.970
makes the trade-off
between margins and volumes

9
00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:23.470
where the firm will lower prices,

10
00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:26.210
accept lower margins, in order to generate

11
00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:28.500
higher levels of overall volume.

12
00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:32.723
Done well, this will give the
firm superior performance.

13
00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:37.430
How would this look like
in a business model?

14
00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:39.030
It can begin anywhere,

15
00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:40.530
but the idea of a business model

16
00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:43.830
is to show how all the parts work together

17
00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:46.163
to create a virtuous cycle.

18
00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:49.310
Let's assume that the firm

19
00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:51.843
intentionally charges lower prices.

20
00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:54.950
Effectively, the firm is re-investing

21
00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:57.900
potential profits in lower prices.

22
00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:00.760
Those lower prices generate higher volumes

23
00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:03.500
because customers are likely to buy more

24
00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:05.320
if prices are lower.

25
00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:08.390
The increased volume gives
the firm an opportunity

26
00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:11.093
to achieve lower costs
through better scale,

27
00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.880
or larger purchasing discounts,

28
00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:15.393
or better economies of scope.

29
00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:19.970
In turn, these lower costs
create increased margins

30
00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:21.973
which can be re-invested.

31
00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:26.340
The margins can be
re-invested in more marketing,

32
00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:29.160
which should drive increased volumes,

33
00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:31.270
which in turn will create better scale

34
00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:32.910
and scope for the firm,

35
00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:35.490
lowering its costs even further.

36
00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:37.160
With further-improved margins,

37
00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:39.980
the firm could invest in more R&amp;D.

38
00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:43.100
That R&amp;D could lead to new
and better-quality products

39
00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:46.200
which should show up in
turn in increased volumes,

40
00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.820
which should improve the scale and scope

41
00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:50.800
of operations even further.

42
00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:53.390
Or the profits could be invested in R&amp;D

43
00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:55.840
to produce process innovations,

44
00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:56.673
which could lead

45
00:01:56.673 --> 00:01:59.640
to more efficient
manufacturing operations.

46
00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:02.680
With every iteration
of the virtuous cycle,

47
00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:06.060
low price and higher volumes join together

48
00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:08.173
to generate higher revenues,

49
00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:11.793
which generate higher firm margins.

50
00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:14.530
What you see in the diagram

51
00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:17.180
are the coherent causal relationships

52
00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:19.720
between the different activities in a firm

53
00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:23.200
that is pursuing a low-cost
leadership business model.

54
00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:25.610
Done well, this business model

55
00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:29.850
should become a
self-reinforcing virtuous cycle.

56
00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:33.460
Over time, firms with
coherent virtuous cycles

57
00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:35.640
can pull away from less efficient

58
00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:37.793
and less coherent rivals.
