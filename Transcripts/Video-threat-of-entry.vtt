1
00:00:00.862 --> 00:00:02.680
- Threat of entry.

2
00:00:02.680 --> 00:00:07.266
How protected is an industry
from new firms entering it?

3
00:00:07.266 --> 00:00:09.485
The threat of new entrants
getting into an industry

4
00:00:09.485 --> 00:00:12.284
and capturing a share of its profitability

5
00:00:12.284 --> 00:00:16.451
depends on how easy or difficult
it is for them to enter.

6
00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:20.838
If it costs little in
terms of time or money

7
00:00:20.838 --> 00:00:24.563
to enter a market and
to compete effectively

8
00:00:24.563 --> 00:00:27.803
then they will do so and
capture profits for themselves.

9
00:00:27.803 --> 00:00:31.477
This will lower the average
level of profitability

10
00:00:31.477 --> 00:00:34.459
earned by firms in the industry.

11
00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:37.212
If an industry has strong and difficult

12
00:00:37.212 --> 00:00:39.696
to overcome entry barriers

13
00:00:39.696 --> 00:00:42.994
then it will be able to
discourage new entrants

14
00:00:42.994 --> 00:00:45.365
and protect its profit streams.

15
00:00:45.365 --> 00:00:49.544
Simply put, industries
that earn high profits

16
00:00:49.544 --> 00:00:52.402
typically attract a lot of attention.

17
00:00:52.402 --> 00:00:55.569
But, industries that earn high profits

18
00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:59.982
over long periods of time tend to do so

19
00:00:59.982 --> 00:01:04.149
because they have done things
to keep other firms out.

20
00:01:05.633 --> 00:01:07.990
What are barriers to entry?

21
00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:11.598
Barriers to entry are unique
industry characteristics

22
00:01:11.598 --> 00:01:15.083
that define the industry, or simply put,

23
00:01:15.083 --> 00:01:18.314
firms in the industry
are able to do things

24
00:01:18.314 --> 00:01:22.491
that entrants cannot do at
the same level of efficiency

25
00:01:22.491 --> 00:01:24.918
or at the same costs.

26
00:01:24.918 --> 00:01:28.157
Barriers to entry reduce
the likelihood of entry

27
00:01:28.157 --> 00:01:32.324
by new firms and in so doing
maintain levels of profits.

28
00:01:33.502 --> 00:01:37.234
There is no exhaustive simple
list of entry barriers,

29
00:01:37.234 --> 00:01:40.787
they take many different
forms and are often unique

30
00:01:40.787 --> 00:01:43.370
to different industries, however,

31
00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:47.617
some of the main categories
of entry barriers are

32
00:01:47.617 --> 00:01:49.737
patents and proprietary knowledge,

33
00:01:49.737 --> 00:01:52.529
patents, copyright,
trademark and firm secrets

34
00:01:52.529 --> 00:01:55.134
prevent others from using the knowledge

35
00:01:55.134 --> 00:01:56.226
in entering the industry.

36
00:01:56.226 --> 00:01:59.091
For example, Polaroid kept Kodak

37
00:01:59.091 --> 00:02:01.393
out of the instant camera market

38
00:02:01.393 --> 00:02:04.981
by suing it for patent
infringement and won.

39
00:02:04.981 --> 00:02:07.845
When innovators prevent
potential competitors

40
00:02:07.845 --> 00:02:12.703
from gaining their knowledge
they can prevent imitation.

41
00:02:12.703 --> 00:02:16.021
Legal and regulatory barriers.

42
00:02:16.021 --> 00:02:19.938
Government sometimes
creates barriers to entry.

43
00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:23.950
When a city licenses taxis and has a limit

44
00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:27.366
on the number of licenses,
this is an entry barrier.

45
00:02:27.366 --> 00:02:30.788
Interestingly however, Uber
has recently found a way

46
00:02:30.788 --> 00:02:34.377
around the barrier to
entry in the taxi market.

47
00:02:34.377 --> 00:02:36.414
Governments often grant firms,

48
00:02:36.414 --> 00:02:39.974
considered to have natural
monopolies, exclusive rights.

49
00:02:39.974 --> 00:02:43.111
For example, telephone companies
were given exclusive rights

50
00:02:43.111 --> 00:02:45.705
to offer phone services to communities,

51
00:02:45.705 --> 00:02:48.675
because cities did not
want multiple phone lines

52
00:02:48.675 --> 00:02:51.342
being strung up and down the streets.

53
00:02:51.342 --> 00:02:54.409
It made no economic sense to
have multiple phone companies

54
00:02:54.409 --> 00:02:56.752
serving the same communities.

55
00:02:56.752 --> 00:03:00.536
Of course today things have changed.

56
00:03:00.536 --> 00:03:03.089
Economies of scale and scope.

57
00:03:03.089 --> 00:03:06.303
If minimum efficient scale
to operate in an industry

58
00:03:06.303 --> 00:03:10.306
is large, relative to
the size of the market,

59
00:03:10.306 --> 00:03:12.581
this may discourage entry

60
00:03:12.581 --> 00:03:16.874
if there are already a few
large competitors in the market.

61
00:03:16.874 --> 00:03:19.482
New entrants will know
that they will likely

62
00:03:19.482 --> 00:03:23.116
have a difficult time
gathering enough market share

63
00:03:23.116 --> 00:03:26.033
from incumbents to break even.

64
00:03:26.033 --> 00:03:27.554
Producer learning.

65
00:03:27.554 --> 00:03:31.012
It is well-known that
manufacturers become more efficient

66
00:03:31.012 --> 00:03:34.233
because experience gained
from producing lots and lots

67
00:03:34.233 --> 00:03:37.790
of products over long periods of time.

68
00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:40.065
BCG, the Boston Consulting Group,

69
00:03:40.065 --> 00:03:42.569
has estimated that with every doubling

70
00:03:42.569 --> 00:03:46.736
of cumulative production
costs fall approximately 20%.

71
00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:51.861
So, a prospective entrant
may be discouraged

72
00:03:51.861 --> 00:03:54.345
from entering a market because incumbents

73
00:03:54.345 --> 00:03:58.936
have strong experience and
learning curve advantages.

74
00:03:58.936 --> 00:04:00.938
Brand and reputation.

75
00:04:00.938 --> 00:04:05.466
Many products cannot be
easily evaluated by a buyer

76
00:04:05.466 --> 00:04:08.466
until they have been purchased and used.

77
00:04:08.466 --> 00:04:10.771
In these situations, new buyers

78
00:04:10.771 --> 00:04:13.509
will observe other consumers

79
00:04:13.509 --> 00:04:15.223
and their satisfaction level

80
00:04:15.223 --> 00:04:17.885
with products that they have purchased.

81
00:04:17.885 --> 00:04:20.385
Well-established brands
and firm reputations

82
00:04:20.385 --> 00:04:23.713
work to reduce potential
customer dissonance.

83
00:04:23.713 --> 00:04:26.549
Simply put, when I can't
evaluate the product

84
00:04:26.549 --> 00:04:30.325
without buying it first and
I'm somewhat risk-averse,

85
00:04:30.325 --> 00:04:33.451
I will likely buy a recognized brand.

86
00:04:33.451 --> 00:04:36.013
In this way, brand and firm reputation

87
00:04:36.013 --> 00:04:38.430
can become barriers to entry.

88
00:04:39.579 --> 00:04:42.443
Advertising and channel crowding.

89
00:04:42.443 --> 00:04:45.381
Early entrants into an industry often face

90
00:04:45.381 --> 00:04:48.997
less crowded advertising message spaces

91
00:04:48.997 --> 00:04:51.167
and distribution channels.

92
00:04:51.167 --> 00:04:53.434
What is the likelihood of
being able to introduce

93
00:04:53.434 --> 00:04:57.677
a new hot dog into the marketplace today?

94
00:04:57.677 --> 00:05:01.396
Supermarket shelves are
already full of hot dogs.

95
00:05:01.396 --> 00:05:03.867
There's a real question
as to where that new TV

96
00:05:03.867 --> 00:05:07.184
and or print advertising
would be effective enough

97
00:05:07.184 --> 00:05:09.594
to catch people's attention,

98
00:05:09.594 --> 00:05:13.923
especially people who already
have a favorite hot dog.

99
00:05:13.923 --> 00:05:18.090
What is the likelihood that
they choose a new brand?

100
00:05:19.227 --> 00:05:22.352
Clearly it would be possible to do this

101
00:05:22.352 --> 00:05:26.175
if you are willing to spend
unlimited amounts of money.

102
00:05:26.175 --> 00:05:29.254
But this is where the
entry barrier occurs.

103
00:05:29.254 --> 00:05:31.558
New entrants cannot, sometimes,

104
00:05:31.558 --> 00:05:35.623
get into a market without
spending more to enter

105
00:05:35.623 --> 00:05:40.256
then they would earn
operating in the industry.

106
00:05:40.256 --> 00:05:42.531
The same is the case with access

107
00:05:42.531 --> 00:05:44.910
to channels of distribution.

108
00:05:44.910 --> 00:05:48.572
Distributors have only a
limited amount of capacity

109
00:05:48.572 --> 00:05:52.126
for different SKUs, as do supermarkets

110
00:05:52.126 --> 00:05:54.338
with limited shelf space.

111
00:05:54.338 --> 00:05:56.845
Those that get in early, sometimes,

112
00:05:56.845 --> 00:05:59.428
have insurmountable advantages.

113
00:06:01.136 --> 00:06:02.905
Switching costs.

114
00:06:02.905 --> 00:06:05.666
When users most make
significant investments

115
00:06:05.666 --> 00:06:08.249
of their own time and
money to use a product

116
00:06:08.249 --> 00:06:11.631
or a service they become stuck,

117
00:06:11.631 --> 00:06:14.193
they cannot easily and costlessly

118
00:06:14.193 --> 00:06:16.610
use a new product or service.

119
00:06:17.690 --> 00:06:21.629
Even a more superior product
may not make traction

120
00:06:21.629 --> 00:06:25.279
in a market because
customers are locked in

121
00:06:25.279 --> 00:06:27.029
to existing products.

122
00:06:28.091 --> 00:06:29.091
Retaliation.

123
00:06:30.147 --> 00:06:33.494
The threat of aggressive
retaliatory action

124
00:06:33.494 --> 00:06:37.255
by industry incumbents
can be a strong deterrent

125
00:06:37.255 --> 00:06:39.918
to potential entrants.

126
00:06:39.918 --> 00:06:41.668
When industry players signal

127
00:06:41.668 --> 00:06:43.800
that they would aggressively drop price,

128
00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:46.675
ramp up production and fill channels

129
00:06:46.675 --> 00:06:49.526
or fight with lawsuits, valid or made up,

130
00:06:49.526 --> 00:06:51.276
this can block entry.

131
00:06:53.196 --> 00:06:57.363
Again, this is not an exhaustive
list of entry barriers.

132
00:06:58.923 --> 00:07:02.934
Anything that makes it difficult
for prospective entrants

133
00:07:02.934 --> 00:07:07.457
to imitate without large
investments of time or money

134
00:07:07.457 --> 00:07:09.957
can act as a barrier to entry.
