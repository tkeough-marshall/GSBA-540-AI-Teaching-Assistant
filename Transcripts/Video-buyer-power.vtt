00:00:00.536 --> 00:00:04.654
- Buyer power, the bargaining
power of buyers of products

2
00:00:04.654 --> 00:00:09.361
or services of the firms
operating in the industry.

3
00:00:09.361 --> 00:00:12.673
Here the issue is to
focus on how easy it is

4
00:00:12.673 --> 00:00:16.545
for buyers to drive down
prices and capture more margin

5
00:00:16.545 --> 00:00:17.795
for themselves.

6
00:00:18.897 --> 00:00:21.057
Buyers will differ by industry.

7
00:00:21.057 --> 00:00:24.113
If it's B to B then the
buyer is another business

8
00:00:24.113 --> 00:00:27.793
in the industry value
chain, perhaps a supermarket

9
00:00:27.793 --> 00:00:29.825
or a department store.

10
00:00:29.825 --> 00:00:34.753
If it is B to C, then the
buyer is the final customer.

11
00:00:34.753 --> 00:00:37.857
The power of buyers is driven
by the number of buyers,

12
00:00:37.857 --> 00:00:41.345
the importance of the buyer
to the firms in the industry,

13
00:00:41.345 --> 00:00:43.713
the ease or difficulty
of customers to switch

14
00:00:43.713 --> 00:00:47.130
between firms in the industry, and so on.

15
00:00:48.065 --> 00:00:52.481
If you have only a few
customers then they are often

16
00:00:52.481 --> 00:00:54.977
able to dictate terms.

17
00:00:54.977 --> 00:00:58.305
Buyers are powerful when
buyers are concentrated.

18
00:00:58.305 --> 00:01:00.737
That is, there are only a few buyers with

19
00:01:00.737 --> 00:01:02.545
significant market share.

20
00:01:02.545 --> 00:01:05.713
For example, if you sell
into the defense industry

21
00:01:05.713 --> 00:01:08.880
you're dealing with only one customer.

22
00:01:10.481 --> 00:01:14.657
When buyers buy significant
portion of your output.

23
00:01:14.657 --> 00:01:18.017
For example, Walmart
demands low prices from most

24
00:01:18.017 --> 00:01:19.425
of its suppliers.

25
00:01:19.425 --> 00:01:22.081
Most Walmart suppliers sell
a significant proportion

26
00:01:22.081 --> 00:01:24.705
of their capacity to Walmart.

27
00:01:24.705 --> 00:01:27.745
When buyers could just as easily produce

28
00:01:27.745 --> 00:01:29.489
the products themselves.

29
00:01:29.489 --> 00:01:33.089
For example, auto manufacturers
could credibly produce

30
00:01:33.089 --> 00:01:36.769
a lot of parts that they
source from their suppliers.

31
00:01:36.769 --> 00:01:39.841
Buyers are weak when
buyers cannot easily switch

32
00:01:39.841 --> 00:01:41.265
between firms.

33
00:01:41.265 --> 00:01:44.577
For example, once I buy
a car I am locked into

34
00:01:44.577 --> 00:01:49.153
the parts and services
provided for that car.

35
00:01:49.153 --> 00:01:51.185
When firms in the industry can threaten

36
00:01:51.185 --> 00:01:54.657
to forward integrate and
sell directly to customers.

37
00:01:54.657 --> 00:01:58.817
For example, movie companies
could own movie theaters

38
00:01:58.817 --> 00:02:02.257
or release their movies
directly to customers

39
00:02:02.257 --> 00:02:05.009
by their own streaming platforms.

40
00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:08.001
When firms in the industry
supply critical components

41
00:02:08.001 --> 00:02:09.084
to customers.

42
00:02:10.081 --> 00:02:12.672
For example Intel semi-conductor chips.

43
00:02:12.672 --> 00:02:15.329
Firms designing them
into their products have

44
00:02:15.329 --> 00:02:16.662
no other option.
