1
00:00:00.755 --> 00:00:03.934
- Objectives of industry analysis.

2
00:00:03.934 --> 00:00:06.093
There are at least four main objectives

3
00:00:06.093 --> 00:00:08.428
of industry analysis.

4
00:00:08.428 --> 00:00:12.378
To understand how industry
structure drives competition,

5
00:00:12.378 --> 00:00:15.233
which in turn determines the level

6
00:00:15.233 --> 00:00:18.030
of industry profitability.

7
00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:20.326
To assess industry attractiveness,

8
00:00:20.326 --> 00:00:23.826
meaning potential long-term profitability.

9
00:00:24.809 --> 00:00:28.113
To anticipate how changes
in industry structure

10
00:00:28.113 --> 00:00:30.409
may impact future profitability.

11
00:00:30.409 --> 00:00:34.654
Here, strategists need to be
able to forecast and predict

12
00:00:34.654 --> 00:00:37.798
future levels of profitability.

13
00:00:37.798 --> 00:00:40.201
To formulate strategies that can change

14
00:00:40.201 --> 00:00:43.518
the structure of an
industry, and in doing so,

15
00:00:43.518 --> 00:00:46.101
improve industry profitability.

16
00:00:47.888 --> 00:00:49.928
Examine this table.

17
00:00:49.928 --> 00:00:52.349
It presents the median profitability

18
00:00:52.349 --> 00:00:55.314
of a select number of US industries.

19
00:00:55.314 --> 00:00:57.455
It reports the median return on equity

20
00:00:57.455 --> 00:01:00.205
for industries from 2000 to 2010.

21
00:01:01.686 --> 00:01:03.339
As you can see from the table,

22
00:01:03.339 --> 00:01:05.716
different industries have very different

23
00:01:05.716 --> 00:01:08.920
characteristic levels of profitability.

24
00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:11.551
While the tobacco industry
had a return on equity

25
00:01:11.551 --> 00:01:14.556
of 35% over that 10 year period,

26
00:01:14.556 --> 00:01:18.306
the airline industry
had a minus 11.3 return.

27
00:01:21.342 --> 00:01:23.434
Makes you wonder why
anyone would want to own

28
00:01:23.434 --> 00:01:25.701
or operate an airline.

29
00:01:25.701 --> 00:01:29.216
Immediately, you all will,
correctly, jump to the conclusion

30
00:01:29.216 --> 00:01:33.019
that much of the reason for
this is the impact of 9/11

31
00:01:33.019 --> 00:01:35.534
on the airline industry.

32
00:01:35.534 --> 00:01:39.785
But, compare food services,
which has a return,

33
00:01:39.785 --> 00:01:41.952
on average, of 19.9%.

34
00:01:45.101 --> 00:01:48.926
With food production, which earns 5.2%.

35
00:01:48.926 --> 00:01:51.631
Obviously, we would all prefer to compete

36
00:01:51.631 --> 00:01:53.840
in the food services industry.

37
00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:56.137
What explains these differences?

38
00:01:56.137 --> 00:02:00.501
Is there a way to systematically
analyze the key drivers

39
00:02:00.501 --> 00:02:04.749
that impact profitability
levels in industries?

40
00:02:04.749 --> 00:02:08.323
Industry analysis is a subject
that consumes immense amounts

41
00:02:08.323 --> 00:02:11.029
of the time of business executives,

42
00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:13.496
consultants, and advisors.

43
00:02:13.496 --> 00:02:15.550
Different diagnostic
frameworks and approaches

44
00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:18.882
have been proposed over
the years; however,

45
00:02:18.882 --> 00:02:21.193
perhaps the best and most
widely known and used

46
00:02:21.193 --> 00:02:24.133
analytical framework
for analyzing industries

47
00:02:24.133 --> 00:02:27.466
was developed by Michael Porter in 1979.

48
00:02:29.181 --> 00:02:31.191
Michael Porter wrote and published

49
00:02:31.191 --> 00:02:33.294
one of the seminal books in strategy

50
00:02:33.294 --> 00:02:36.294
called Competitive Strategy in 1980.

51
00:02:37.702 --> 00:02:40.369
It is still worth reading today.

52
00:02:41.937 --> 00:02:44.343
Michael Porter's important contribution

53
00:02:44.343 --> 00:02:48.022
to the field of strategy
was what is now called

54
00:02:48.022 --> 00:02:50.024
Porter's Five Forces.

55
00:02:50.024 --> 00:02:53.522
Porter simplified the
diagnosis of industry structure

56
00:02:53.522 --> 00:02:55.272
into five key forces.

57
00:02:56.842 --> 00:02:59.824
In a very real way, he
practiced good strategy.

58
00:02:59.824 --> 00:03:04.406
He provided a simpler model
of a more complex world.

59
00:03:04.406 --> 00:03:05.746
Something that managers

60
00:03:05.746 --> 00:03:08.883
could actually get their heads around.

61
00:03:08.883 --> 00:03:12.087
Many have come to criticize
Porter's Five Forces framework

62
00:03:12.087 --> 00:03:15.076
as being overly simplistic; however,

63
00:03:15.076 --> 00:03:18.139
they fail to understand
that Porter recognized

64
00:03:18.139 --> 00:03:21.414
it was not possible to think
about all the things going on

65
00:03:21.414 --> 00:03:23.450
in an industry at any time,

66
00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:25.740
that is, the complexity of an industry,

67
00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:28.423
without a simpler model.

68
00:03:28.423 --> 00:03:32.205
Porter understood that there
were three key influences,

69
00:03:32.205 --> 00:03:34.786
or determinants, of
industry profitability.

70
00:03:34.786 --> 00:03:38.680
The first, the value of the
product to the customer.

71
00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:41.619
That is their willingness to pay.

72
00:03:41.619 --> 00:03:44.786
Second, intensity of industry rivalry.

73
00:03:46.312 --> 00:03:49.464
And third, the relative bargaining power

74
00:03:49.464 --> 00:03:51.720
of different players at different stages

75
00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:54.053
of the industry value chain.

76
00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:56.973
Porter created a framework

77
00:03:56.973 --> 00:04:00.198
that simplified the drivers
of competitive intensity

78
00:04:00.198 --> 00:04:04.115
and attractiveness of
markets into five forces.

79
00:04:04.972 --> 00:04:07.838
Number one, bargaining power of suppliers.

80
00:04:07.838 --> 00:04:10.782
Number two, bargaining power of buyers.

81
00:04:10.782 --> 00:04:14.235
Number three, rivalry among existing firms

82
00:04:14.235 --> 00:04:15.781
within the industry.

83
00:04:15.781 --> 00:04:19.500
Number four, the threat of new
entrants into the industry.

84
00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:22.667
And number five, threat of substitute.

85
00:04:24.602 --> 00:04:28.769
Let's discuss each of these
in a little bit more detail.
